# Styling

There are few colours used by Bakaru GUI:

- `bg` - Main background colour used literally everywhere.
- `bg-hl` - `bg` colour replacement when highlight occurs (on mouse hover for example).
- `fg` - Main foreground colour used, yup, everywhere.
- `fg-dim` - Dim foreground colour shade for insignificant text.
- `accent` - Accent colour, mainly for buttons, window title and selected elements indicators.
- `border` - Border colour.
