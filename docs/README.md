# B-baka don't look!!!

Bakaru is baked by this beautiful projects:

- Electron, application runtime
- mpv.js, video/audio player, the only not-hipster tech here, yay!
- Inferno, GUIs runtime
- Redux, GUIs state runtime
- WebSockets, communication between app and GUIs
- FFmpeg, provides Bakaru with media info

The set is so because sempai is too lazy to learn some C++ `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`


# Self-identification

Bakaru aims to seamlessly play anime with dubs, wherever they are, like they're embedded in video container :p
